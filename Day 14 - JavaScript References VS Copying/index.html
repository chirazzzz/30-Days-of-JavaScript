  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 30;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(`same age: ${age}, ${age2}`);
    age = 40;
    console.log(`should be different age: ${age}, ${age2}`);

    let name = 'Chirag';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(`same name: ${name}, ${name2}`);
    name = 'Kate';
    console.log(`different name: ${name}, ${name2}`);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // returns ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"] which is correct!

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Gertrude'; assume that you are only changing team array

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team); // returns ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Gertrude"] for both

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // returns full copy of players into new team2 array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team2, team3); // shows the copies
    team2[3] = 'Kate';
    team3[3] = 'Darshana'
    console.log(team2, team3, players); // show how these copies can be mutated without changing original

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Chirag';

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[2] = 'Zig';
    team5[3] = 'Zag';

    // now when we update it, the original players array isn't changed
    console.log(team4, players);
    console.log(team5, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99; Same deal with array above. changing captain will change the original object
    // console.log(captain, person); returns age: 99 for both

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    /* bullshit way with Object.assign where
      arg1 = empty obj   arg2 = copied obj with props   arg3 = new props
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    console.log(cap2, person); // cap2- age: 99  person - age: 80 */

    // BEST WAY object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.name = 'Crazy Horse';
    cap3.age = 23;
    console.log(cap3, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const chirag = {
      name: 'Chirag',
      age: 35,
      social: {
        twitter: '@chirag_uk',
        facebook: 'chirag.uk'
      }
    }

    console.log(chirag); // social.twitter has been changed to @wesbos because its 2 levels deep

    const chiragCopy = {...chirag};
    chiragCopy.social.twitter = '@wesbos';
    chiragCopy.age = 36;
    console.log(chiragCopy); // age can be changed

    // Workaround with poor mans deep clone - possible performance issues
    const kate = {
      name: 'Kate',
      age: 34,
      social: {
        twitter: 'juicygoosey',
        facebook: 'grumblepants'
      }
    }

    const kateCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(kate)); // this changes obj => string => obj
    kateCopy.social.twitter = 'Hucknallita';
    console.log(kate, kateCopy); // different twitter handles even though its 2 levels deep
